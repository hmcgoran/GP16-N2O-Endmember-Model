# GP16-N2O-Endmember-Model
This code uses an isotope mixing model adapted from Peters et al. 2018 which analyzed NO3- end members in the transect. The objective is to quantify the relative contributions of four N2O end members (background, AOA, incomplete denitrification (ID), and Oxygen Deficient Zone (ODZ)) in the GP16 transect.
