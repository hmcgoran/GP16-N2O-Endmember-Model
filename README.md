# GP16-N2O-Endmember-Model
This code uses an isotope mixing model adapted from Peters et al. 2018 which analyzed NO3- end members in the transect. The objective is to quantify the relative contributions of four N2O end members (background, AOA, incomplete denitrification (ID), and Oxygen Deficient Zone (ODZ)) in the GP16 transect. 

Broadly, the methodology involves defining the delta values of background N2O, AOA-produced N2O, ID-produced N2O, N2O produced in the ODZ, and a multiple linear least squares regression to estimate the relative contributions of each end member.

The Colab is integrated with two Google Sheets: V4_COLAB Final GP16 Regression Model and V4_COLAB Water Mass Delta Definitions. To run the code and make edits to the Colab, you should make a copy of the Colab + two sheets linked below, and then update the links to the sheet in the Colab. The data referenced and generated by this Google Colab can be found below:

The code is based on data from GP16, meaning that all of the sheets referenced are also specific to GP16. To adapt this code to other cases, you would need to link different Google Sheets, change variable names, column names, and anything else that is specific to the region.
